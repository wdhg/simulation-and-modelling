# Poisson Processes

A _Poisson arrival processes_ is an arrival stream where the inter-arrival times \\( T \\) are both independent and _exponentially distributed_:

\\[
P(T \\le t) = 1 - e^{(-\\lambda t)}
\\]

Here, \\( \\lambda \\) is often called the processes' "rate" parameter and is equal to the reciprocal of the average inter-arrival time.

Since the inter-arrival times are exponentially distributed, for a fixed time window the number of arrivals is _poisson distributed_:

\\[
P(A_t = n) = {(\\lambda t)^n * e^{-Î»t} \\over n!}
\\]

where \\( A_t \\) is the number of arrivals for time interval \\( t \\).

Poisson processes are often an effective approximation for real world random arrival processes as arrivals are typically:

1. independent to each other.
2. ignorant of previous arrivals and the state of the system they are arriving at.
