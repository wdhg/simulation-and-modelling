# Resources

If a resource (server, mutex, network port, etc) is busy for a total time of `B`, then:

1. The _utilisation_ of that resource is `U = B/T` (the proportion of time that the resource is being used)
2. The _average service time_ of each job at the resource is `S = B/C`
3. The _service rate_ is `Âµ = S^-1 = C/B`
