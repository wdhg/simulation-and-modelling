# Resources

If a resource (server, mutex, network port, etc) is busy for a total time of \\( B \\), then:

1. The _utilisation_ of that resource is \\( U = {B \\over T} \\) (the proportion of time that the resource is being used)
2. The _average service time_ of each job at the resource is \\( S = {B \\over C} \\)
3. The _service rate_ is \\( \\mu = S^{-1} = {C \\over B} \\)
