# The Flow Balance Assumption

Typically the number of arrivals is equal to the number of completions (i.e. \\( \\lambda = X \\)). This is the case when either the number of arrivals and completions are equal (\\( A = C \\)) or if their difference (\\( A - C \\)) is small in comparison to them. A system that is in _equilibrium_ (or _steady state_) must satisfy this.

If over time (as \\( T \\rightarrow \\infty \\)) this assumption does not hold, then the system is fundamentally unstable.
