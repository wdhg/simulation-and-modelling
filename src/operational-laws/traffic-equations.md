# Traffic Equations

Consider an arbitrary system with \\( n \\) nodes, where each node \\( k \\) in \\( 1 \\le k \\le n \\) has \\( C_k \\) completions. When the system is at equilibrium, the number of arrivals is equal to the system to the number of completions \\( A = C \\), and each job arrives exactly once to the system.

Now consider two arbitrary and distinct nodes \\( i \\) and \\( j \\) where \\( 1 \\le i, j \\le n \\). Assume that a job that comletes at \\( i \\) has a fixed probability \\( r_{ij} \\) of moving to node \\( j \\). Then for any node \\( k \\), the number of completions \\( C_k \\) must equal the sum of:

1. the number of arrivals to the system \\( A \\) multiplied by the probability that an arriving job will move to node \\( k \\) directly, denoted as \\( a_k \\).
2. the sum of the products of every node's number of completions and probability that a job will move to \\( k \\) (note this includes the cyclic arc from \\( k \\) to \\( k \\)).

\\[
C_k = A a_k + C_1 r_{1k} + C_2 r_{2k} + \\ldots + C_n r_{nk}
\\]


If both sides are divided by the total number of completions in the system \\( C \\) we get an equation for the number of visits \\(V_k = {C_k \\over C} \\):

\\[
V_k = a_k + V_1 r_{1k} + V_2 r_{2k} + \\ldots + V_n r_{nk}
\\]

Note that \\( A = C \\) hence why it disappears from \\(A a_k \\).

If we divide by the total time \\( T \\) instead, we get an equation for the node throughput \\( X_k \\):

\\[
X_k = \\gamma_k + X_1 r_{1k} + X_2 * r_{2k} + \\ldots + X_n * r_{nk}
\\]

where \\( \\gamma_k = X a_k \\) is the direct contribution to throughput from external arrivals.

We can now take these equations and turn them into vector equations:

\\[
\\vec{V} (\\boldsymbol{I} - \\boldsymbol{R}) = \\vec{a}
\\]
\\[
\\vec{X} (\\boldsymbol{I} - \\boldsymbol{R}) = \\vec{\\gamma}
\\]

where:

- \\( \\vec{V} \\) is the vector of number of visits for each node.
- \\( \\boldsymbol{I} \\) is the identity matrix.
- \\( \\boldsymbol{R} \\) is the maxtrix of probabilities that a job goes from node \\( i \\) to node \\( j \\).
- \\( \\vec{\\gamma} \\) is the vector of direct contributions to throughput from external arrivals for each node.

Note that often we use arrival rate of node \\( i \\) (denoted as \\( Î»_i \\)) instead of throughput. Since arrival rate is the same as throughput, we can write:

\\[
\\vec{\\lambda} (\\boldsymbol{I} - \\boldsymbol{R}) = \\vec{\\gamma}
\\]
