# Open and Closed Systems

An **open system** is one where jobs can flow in and out of it freely. As a result, the number of jobs in the system can vary over time.

In a **closed system**, the number of jobs circulating around is fixed to some value `N`. An example of a closed system is:

```

  *------------------*
  |                  |
  |                  |
  |                  |
  *---->(System)-----*

```

The throughput of this example system is the traffic rate on the looping (ingoing and outgoing) arc.
