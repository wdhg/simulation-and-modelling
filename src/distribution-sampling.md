# Distribution Sampling

To be able to simulate models, the simulations have to be able to sample the underlying probability distributions. There are four commonly-used methods to do this:

1. Inverse transform method.
2. Acceptance-Rejection (AR) method.
3. Convolution method.
4. Composition method.
